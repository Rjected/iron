* Some observations on the contents of .projections
---------------------------------------------------  
First, note that make-projections seems to be a bit of a black box; there's
no written spec for the files that it creates that I can find. So the
.projection-based cr-compatibility obligation front end was written by means
of some poking and prodding it to see what it does.

Some things that I have observed:
+ The union of build-info/*/all for all dirs but leftover is *exactly*
  .projections/all.
+ build-info/leftover/all has no intersection with .projections/all.
+ But the contents of build-info/leftover/all are all in the hg manifest.
+ as is the contents of every build-info/*/all file.
+ No files in deprecated/ appear in .projections/all.
